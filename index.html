<h1>Yo Eagles Are Dope</h1>

<img src = "https://www.nationaleaglecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/Angel_2017a.jpg">

<p>Eagles are birds of prey in the family Accipitridae; there are approximately 60 different species. The majority are found in Eurasia and Africa, with only 14 species found in other areas including North, Central and South America, and Australia.</p>

<p>With the exception of some vultures, eagles are generally larger than other birds of prey. They have strong muscular legs, powerful talons and large hooked beaks that enable them to rip the flesh from their prey.</p>

<p>Eagles vary in size. One of the smallest species, the little eagle, is around 17.7–21.7 in (45–55 cm). In contrast, Stellers’s sea eagle is around 36–42 in (91–106 cm) in size, and wingspan can reach approximately 72–96 in (2–2.5 m).
